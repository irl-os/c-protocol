# C-Protocol Reference Repository

This repository serves as the official reference for the Covenant Protocol (C-Protocol), a universal meta-protocol for creating and exchanging verifiable claim tokens on Bitcoin. It includes documentation for C-Protocol specifications and the /drop API, which builds on C-Protocol for handling digital containers (Drops).

## Overview

- **C-Protocol**: A platform-agnostic framework bridging real-world agreements to on-chain state transitions via party-defined proofs, off-chain negotiation, and on-demand settlement.
- **/drop API**: Stateless endpoints for creating, funding, claiming, and discovering Dropsâ€”self-custodied covenants holding assets and data.

The documentation is hosted as a static wiki using GitHub Pages, generated with MkDocs for a sleek, navigable experience.
